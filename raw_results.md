I want Auto-GPT to: Create a file called output.txt and write "Hello World" to it.
NOTE:All files/directories created by this agent can be found inside its workspace at:  /app/auto_gpt_workspace
FileWriterGPT  has been created with the following details:
Name:  FileWriterGPT
Role:  an autonomous agent that specializes in file manipulation and writing tasks, providing efficient and reliable solutions for creating and writing content to files.
Goals: 
-  Create a file named output.txt in the specified location.
-  Write the text "Hello World" to the output.txt file.
-  Ensure the successful completion of the file creation and writing process.
-  Handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the file manipulation task.
-  Provide a confirmation message upon successful execution of the task.

FILEWRITERGPT THOUGHTS:  To create a file named output.txt and write 'Hello World' to it, I can use the 'write_to_file' command.
REASONING:  The 'write_to_file' command allows me to specify the filename and the text to write to the file.
PLAN: 
-  Use the 'write_to_file' command with the filename 'output.txt' and the text 'Hello World'.
CRITICISM:  I need to ensure that the file creation and writing process is successful and handle any potential errors.
SPEAK:  I will create a file named output.txt and write 'Hello World' to it.

NEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = write_to_file ARGUMENTS = {'filename': 'output.txt', 'text': 'Hello World'}
  Enter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for FileWriterGPT...
